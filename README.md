# forecast

## Description
As a user I want to be able to go to a website and get a weather forecast for the City and State that I enter.

When I type in the City and State and click the search button
Then the weather for today is displayed and underneath the current weather is a five day forecast.

When I click the search button
Then my input is validated and saved to a list under the input field if it is valid. If it is not valid I am presented with an alert window.

When I click a saved entry
Then I am presented with weather information for that location.

When I click the delete button
Then that entry is removed from the saved list.
